# CoverDetectionHub

## Project description

The aim of the project is to prepare a framework for music cover detection. The main assumption is to implement a "hub" that lets further researchers carry out various experiments in this field as well as compare different Music Information Retrieval (MIR) methods.

Moreover, authors of the paper and dataset also provide a  framework for feature extraction and benchmarking - [acoss: Audio Cover Song Suite](https://github.com/furkanyesiler/acoss). 'acoss' includes a standard feature extraction framework with audio features for CSI task and open source implementations of seven CSI algorithms. It was designed to facilitate the future work in this line of research. Although dataset in relatively new (2019), both repositories have not been updated since 5 years ago and considering how rapidly MIR domain develops - 5 years is a lot. That is why our project can be an attempt to create a refreshed and modern version of this framework. It would include state-of-the-art methods with hopefully additional datasets to test them.


## Environment setup
Our proposed technology stack is based on Python, considering its great capabilities for working with data in an easy way.

## Dataset for experiments

We intend to use Da-TACOS dataset (https://github.com/MTG/da-tacos) because of its versatility, decent size and excellent metadata structure. It is organised into cliques that gather an original performance along with its covers, which fits perfectly into our needs.

In future extensions, it is possible to utilize a dataset delivered by the Polish Society of Authors ZAiKS.
