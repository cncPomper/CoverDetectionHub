## Dataset for experiments

We intend to use Da-TACOS dataset (https://github.com/MTG/da-tacos) because of its versatility, decent size and excellent metadata structure. It is organised into cliques that gather an original performance along with its covers, which fits perfectly into our needs.

In future extensions, it is possible to utilize a dataset delivered by the Polish Society of Authors ZAiKS.
